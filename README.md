# MXAO

> MXAO is a state-of-the-art (within the limits of ReShade) Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion shader with numerous unique features that help give an edge over regular SSAO implementations commonly found in games. Disable in-game SSAO, enable MXAO, never go back!

# DOF

> A beautiful Bokeh Depth of Field shader with artistic controls, usable for both gameplay and sophisticated screenshots. Highly optimized towards maximal visual quality and performance, employing numerous tricks that are not found in any other point-splatting based DoF shaders, such as a gradient-based chromatic aberration filter for axial CA at constant cost, a sophisticated color leak solution that completely migitates focused areas leaking their color into blurred areas (all available DoF shaders underperform in this except those that premultiply CoC, but that requires large color buffer with floating point precision, this shader does it in 8 bit).

# Lightroom

> The shader to replace all color grading shaders currently in place in your ReShade preset! It features all features of the popular Adobe Lightroom - in realtime, tweakable in-game! Clean up bloated presets with tons of generic color grading stacked, replace with one sleek combo with industry-standard controls. 

# Bloom

> Highly performant (0.1ms on GTX1080 @1440p) and visually appealing bloom shader that helps freshen up dated game visuals with an adaptive, high quality bloom layer at little to none performance overhead.
